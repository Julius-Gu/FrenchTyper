# FrenchTyper
A small GTK+3.0 programm for copying French Characters to the clipboard


This idea came when I had to write a french text on a German Keyboard.
Hope it will be usefull.

Dependencies are libgtk-3-0
(sudo apt install libgtk-3-0)
The C File can be compiled on Linux with
cd [Directory of the File]
gcc FrenchTyper.c -o FrenchTyper `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-3.0`

this is the first project I hosted so please let me know about any
mistakes or if you would like a license change. (I am fine with changing it
to e.g. MIT Licence on request)

Best Regards, Julius
